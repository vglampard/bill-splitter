# WORK IN PROGRESS

We can all whip out a calculator to split a dinner bill.

But what if Alice paid for dinner, Bob paid for the Taxi, and Charlie paid for drinks? They want to split it all evenly - but everyone owes everyone! And everyone is OWED by everyone!

PayBack Machine is a work-in-progress Redux app to consolidate all these different owings and debts into one simple payment.

It's already working for a single cluster of payments. Type in the name and amount of money contributed by each person, and hit 'calculate' to work out how to untangle the payback knot in a single transfer.  

Alice, Bob, and Charlie can rest easy. 

Next up: co-ordinate across multiple 'clusters'. What if before dinner, Alice and Bob go for drinks - and after dinner, Bob gets Charlie a taxi? 

We can still trim this down into a single payment for each! Watch this space.
